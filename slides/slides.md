+ Loves **Impartially** <span class="ref">(2:5-9)</span>

<span class="ref">6</span>
The **tongue** also is a **fire**, <br/>
a **world of evil** among the parts of the body.

It **corrupts** the whole body, <br/>
sets the whole **course** of one’s life on fire, <br/>
and is itself set on fire by **hell**.

---
<span class="ref">7</span>
All kinds of **animals**, birds, <br/>
reptiles and sea creatures <br/>
are being **tamed** and have been tamed by mankind,

<span class="ref">8</span>
but **no** human being can **tame the tongue**. <br/>
It is a **restless evil**, full of **deadly poison**.

---
<span class="ref">9</span>
With the tongue we **praise** our Lord and Father,

and with it we **curse** human beings, <br/>
who have been made in God’s **likeness**.

<span class="ref">10</span>
Out of the **same** mouth come **praise** and **cursing**. <br/>
My brothers and sisters, this **should not be**.

When we put **bits** <br/>
into the mouths of **horses** <br/>
to make them **obey** us, <br/>
we can **turn** the whole animal.

>>>
+ **steering**: direction, course
+ **subjugation**: control, power, obey

<span class="ref">4</span>
Or take **ships** as an example.

Although they are so **large** <br/>
and are driven by strong **winds**,

they are **steered** by a very small **rudder** <br/>
wherever the pilot **wants** to go.

>>>
+ steering
+ submission

<span class="ref">5</span>
Consider what a great **forest** <br/>
is set on **fire** by a small **spark**.

>>>
+ *how great a fire* kindles
  + *how great a wood* (forest)
+ **consumes** entire forest
+ **uncontainable** / uncontrollable
+ what took **years** to build
  + consumed in **minutes**

<span class="ref">6</span>
The **tongue** also is a **fire**, <br/>
a **world of evil** among the parts of the body.

>>>
+ *world* (ὁ κόσμος): **totality**, complete ordering
+ every evil can be **expressed** through tongue
+ not **exclusive** to tongue
  + e.g., **eyes**, finger, hands
  + but **especially** tongue
+ *tongue* represents **speech**: me'to-ny-my
+ **body** holy, created by God
  + how we **use** it: world of evil

<span class="ref">Mark 7:20</span>
What comes out of a person is what defiles them.

<span class="ref">21</span>
For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, <br/>
that evil thoughts come —

sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <br/>
greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, <br/>
envy, slander, arrogance and folly.

>>>
+ not eating **food** that defiles
+ but **speech** from overflow of heart

---
<span class="ref">6</span>
It **corrupts** the whole body,

>>>
+ *corrupter* (ἡ σπιλοῦσα): spot, stain
  + all **else** could be holy, but
  + **one** unholy utterance, and
  + **focus** on the stain
  + like white tablecloth with wine spot

---
<span class="ref">6</span>
sets the whole **course** of one’s life on fire, <br/>
and is itself set on fire by **hell**.

>>>
+ *course of life* (τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως):
  + **wheel**, run: sequence / pattern
+ *on fire* (φλογίζουσα): inflame, arouse
  + c.f. v5 *kindle*
  + easily **angered**, chip
+ **hell** (τῆς γεέννης): valley of **Hinnom**
  + trash/bodies **burned**
