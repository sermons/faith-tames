The **tongue** also is a **fire**, <br/>
a **world of evil** among the parts of the body.

It **corrupts** the whole body, <br/>
sets the whole **course** of one’s life on fire, <br/>
and is itself set on fire by **hell**.

<span class="ref">7</span>
All kinds of **animals**, birds, <br/>
reptiles and sea creatures <br/>
are being **tamed** and have been tamed by mankind,

<span class="ref">8</span>
but **no** human being can **tame the tongue**.

It is a **restless evil**, full of **deadly poison**.

---
<span class="ref">9</span>
With the tongue we **praise** our Lord and Father,

and with it we **curse** human beings, <br/>
who have been made in God’s **likeness**.

<span class="ref">10</span>
Out of the **same** mouth come **praise** and **cursing**. <br/>
My brothers and sisters, this **should not be**.

Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.

Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.

Mar 7:20 — Mar 7:23

20 He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. 21 For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, 22 adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23 All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”
