The **tongue** also is a **fire**, <br/>
a **world of evil** among the parts of the body.

It **corrupts** the whole body, <br/>
sets the whole **course** of one’s life on fire, <br/>
and is itself set on fire by **hell**.

<span class="ref">7</span>
All kinds of **animals**, birds, <br/>
reptiles and sea creatures <br/>
are being **tamed** and have been tamed by mankind,

<span class="ref">8</span>
but **no** human being can **tame the tongue**. <br/>
It is a **restless evil**, full of **deadly poison**.

---
<span class="ref">9</span>
With the tongue we **praise** our Lord and Father,

and with it we **curse** human beings, <br/>
who have been made in God’s **likeness**.

<span class="ref">10</span>
Out of the **same** mouth come **praise** and **cursing**. <br/>
My brothers and sisters, this **should not be**.

What comes **out** of a person is what defiles them.

<span class="ref">21</span>
For it is from **within**, out of a person’s **heart**, <br/>
that **evil** thoughts come —

sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <br/>
greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, <br/>
envy, slander, arrogance and folly.

>>>
+ not eating **food** that defiles

## David Platt, <em>Radical</em>
God beckons **storm clouds** and they come.

He tells the **wind** to blow and the **rain** to fall,
and they **obey** immediately.

He speaks to the **mountains**, "You go there,"
and He says to the **seas**, "You stop here,"
and they do it.

Everything in all **creation** responds
in **obedience** to the Creator ...

## Mark 2:5-7 <span class="ref">(NIV) (p.1/2)</span>
When Jesus saw their **faith**, he said to the **paralyzed** man,
“Son, your **sins** are forgiven.”

<span class="ref">6</span>
Now some **teachers** of the law were sitting there,
**thinking** to themselves,

<span class="ref">7</span>
“**Why** does this fellow talk like that?
He’s **blaspheming**! Who can forgive sins but **God** alone?”

Immediately Jesus **knew** in his spirit that
this was what they were **thinking** in their **hearts**,

and he said to them, “**Why** are you thinking these things?
<span class="ref">9</span>
Which is **easier**:

to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are **forgiven**,’
or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and **walk**’?

>>>
+ Not just **spoken** word!
  + e.g., **vow** of silence
+ Words in our **thoughts**, too!
